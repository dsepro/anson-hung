    personalStatementWhyTitle: "Why Dietetics?",
    personalStatementWhyBody: "While working at two hospitals in Hong Kong, I observed many patients struggling to adhere to low-sodium and low-fat diets while enjoying traditional Chinese dishes. As a Food and Nutritional Science graduate, I see these challenges as a complex interplay of nutrition and cultural heritage. My academic background enables me to analyse dietary needs through biochemistry and sociocultural factors. Moreover, with an aging population presenting public health challenges, I am eager to support individuals in making informed dietary choices and enhancing their quality of life.",
    personalStatementExperienceTitle: "My Career Vision",
    personalStatementExperienceBody: "Community Nutrition Innovation: I aim to establish community kitchens that merge traditional Chinese dietary wisdom with precision nutrition. These kitchens will serve as hubs for education, where I wish to offer lessons that inspire healthier cooking and eating habits. This initiative will act as a primary intervention to reduce preventable diseases through early nutritional support and public education. By fostering community engagement, we can promote better health outcomes and create a culture of healthier eating.\nDigital Health Tool: I plan to develop a comprehensive app that enables users to track their food intake and estimate nutrient consumption. It will provide personalized recipe recommendations based on health conditions and allow users to monitor key health metrics. By offering accessible nutritional information and guidance, this app can positively impact community nutritional health by raising awareness of healthy eating habits and preventing diet-related diseases. With real-time support from registered dietitians, users will be encouraged to adopt proactive health management, ultimately fostering a healthier community. (An online demo of my app is available at https://anson-hung.netlify.app/)\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) Integration: I wish to integrate AI into nutritional practices to enhance the management of diet-related diseases like diabetes. AI’s ability to analyse vast amounts of data allows for personalized insights that traditional methods cannot provide. For example, I can adapt traditional tong sui (sweet soups) for diabetic patients using predictive analytics to estimate the glycaemic load. By leveraging AI to personalize treatment plans, I aim to empower individuals in their health journeys with tailored dietary solutions that promote healthier eating habits. Ultimately, I hope to reduce the prevalence of diet-related diseases and foster proactive health management within the community.",
    personalStatementReasonsTitle: "Why This Programme?",
    personalStatementReasonsBody: "Bridging Theory and Practice: This course emphasizes both academic and practical training. The opportunity to engage in a full-time placement at a hospital is particularly appealing, as it allows me to apply my knowledge in a real-world seeing and gain invaluable hands-on-experience.\nCultural Relevance: Ulster’s HCPC accreditation ensures my training meets global standards, while HKU SPACE’s local partnerships align with my focus on Cantonese foodways and enhance my understanding of local healthcare systems and patient expectations.\nFlexibility for impact: The part-time structure of the first year allows me to continue with my current professional commitments and gives me the flexibility to remain active in the field while deepening my academic knowledge.",
    personalStatementConclusionTitle: "Conclusion",
    personalStatementConclusionBody: "My Food & Nutritional Science training has prepared me to innovate at the intersection of tradition and technology. Through this program, I will gain the clinical expertise to transform Hong Kong’s nutritional landscape, one culturally attuned meal plan at a time.",
